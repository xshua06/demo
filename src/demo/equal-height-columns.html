工作中时常会碰到一种布局需求，即一行有两列或多列内容，且每一列的高度是不定的，但是我们希望无论内容多少，<br />
每一列看起来始终是一样高的（等于最高列的高度）。当列数比较少时，例如两列，我们可以选择使用一张背景图垂直平铺来解决，<br />
但是当列数比较多时呢？如果再用图片就显得不太妥当。这里展示一种不用背景图、不用hack、不用JavaScript的方法。
</p>
<p>
这个布局技巧的原理是：我们设置每一列的padding-bottom足够大（根据盒模型，背景色存在于padding上），<br />
但这撑大了外层容器的高度，接着我们通过设置列的margin-bottom为负值（绝对值与padding-bottom相等），<br />
并且外层容器的overflow为hidden，使容器高度回到原有值，它截断了每一列，这看起来就是我们想要的效果。
